## Homepage
This the landing page for the organization account. This can be minimally customized using basic html with internal css.

JHU’s landing page is set up to provide users with easy access to Data Services info (who we are, our workshops), geospatial downloads, curated datasets, and Esri’s tutorials.

## Groups
Groups create structure for the organization and allow the org to organize members and content around specific projects, workflows and initiatives. Groups can be set up to allow access to specific items or to share items with a smaller subset of your organization and grant them special rights. The following can be configured:

### Share Settings
* Only group members – only members of the group can find and view the group. Members must be invited to join the group.
* People in the organization – only members of the organization can find and view the group. Members must be invited to join the group.
* Everyone (public) – anyone can find and view the group. Even if they are not a member of the organization.

### Join Settings
* Those who request membership and are approved by a group manager – only members who request to join the group and are approved by the group owner or a group manager can join the group.
* Only those invited by a group manager – Only members who are invited by the group owner or a group manager can join the group.
* Anyone – Any organization member can join the group without being invited or approved. Members of other organizations can join the group as long as they have privileges to join external groups. Members who click Join this Group on the group page are instantly granted membership in the group.
