# What is ArcGIS Online
[ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com/) (agol) is a software-as-a-service cloud-based mapping and analysis platform. It is produced and managed by [Esri](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home), the leading provider of geospatial software and technology.

Agol is part of what Esri calls its “Esri Geospatial Cloud”: it links members to other Esri products such as geospatial desktop software (ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Desktop Suite, ArcGIS Business Analyst desktop, CityEngine, etc), cloud-based extensions (Open Data hubs, Business Analyst online, Survey123), and geospatial data.

Users are able to upload their own datasets, make web maps and web applications, and share all three of the latter with themselves; a group they are a member of; an organization; or the general public. Users are also able to search for and access geospatial data across the entirety of the agol system.

Many federal, regional, state and local government agencies use either agol or Esri’s enterprise version of agol (ArcGIS Portal) to share out data. Some examples:
* [Maryland GIS Open Data](https://maryland.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html)
*	[Baltimore City Open GIS Data](http://gis-baltimore.opendata.arcgis.com/)
*	[US Forest Service ArcGIS Online](https://usfs.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html)

## What is an ArcGIS Online organization
ArcGIS Online organizations connect members from the same school, business, or other association. They facilitate sharing between members and can also be customized to suit the organization's needs.

Each ArcGIS Organization subscription comes with a certain number of individual user accounts (called organizational accounts) and a starting number of credits. The number of organizational accounts is determined by the subscription (see general pricing schema).

Credits are how Esri manages costs. ‘Premium services’, such as the storage of data, the running of geoprocessing and spatial analysis tools, and the usage of premium data, consume credits. Rather than including a specific number of transactions for each premium service available in agol, every subscription includes credits that can be used for any premium services (see credit table).

Note, administrative aspects of cloud hosting, like instance size and bandwidth, are managed by Esri. These costs are not passed along to the organization.
